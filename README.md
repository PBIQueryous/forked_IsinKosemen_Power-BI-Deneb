# My Showcases of Custom Visuals in Power BI with Deneb
Here is a collection of my showcases that I built in Power BI with Deneb using Vega and Vega-Lite libraries.
Feast your eyes on some of my best work.

# The Economist's Big Mac Index - Dot Plot Chart With Dynamic Text
I used Power BI slicers for Base Currency, and Index Period filter options. The rest of the custom visual was built in Deneb with Vega-Lite library.
I used params to change the color of the points and display the dynamic text when I hover and click on each one of them. The most challenging part 
of re-creating this visual was applying different font colors to different parts of the text. I had to break down the text to apply multiple colors, and 
I used the Monospace fixed-width font, so that I could get even spacing between each block of text.
