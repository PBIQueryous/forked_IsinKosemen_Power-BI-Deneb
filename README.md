# My Showcases of Custom Visuals in Power BI with Deneb
Here is a collection of my showcases that I built in Power BI with Deneb using Vega and Vega-Lite libraries.
Feast your eyes on some of my best work.

# The Economist's Big Mac Index - Dot Plot Chart With Dynamic Text
I used Power BI slicers for Base Currency, and Index Period filter options. The rest of the custom visual was built in Deneb with Vega-Lite library.
I used params to change the color of the points and display the dynamic text when I hover and click on each one of them. The most challenging part 
of re-creating this visual was applying different font colors to different parts of the text. I had to break down the text to apply multiple colors, and 
I used the Monospace fixed-width font, so that I could get even spacing between each block of text.

# Information is Beautiful Creative Challange 2023
Here is the [Power BI interactive dashboard](https://isinkosemen.com/a_decade_of_electricity_production.html) I created for the 2023 "Information is Beautiful" creative challange. 

I used [Deneb pattern fills](https://deneb-viz.github.io/pattern-fills) to represent and highlight each source for the electricity production and their share between 2010 and 2020.

My interactive dashboard was included in the [interactive longlist](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/world-dataviz-prize-2023-interactives-longlist/) chosen by the jury.

# Turkey's Ring of Fire

I used USGS earthquake data for [this interactive visual](https://isinkosemen.com/turkey_ring_of_fire.html).
